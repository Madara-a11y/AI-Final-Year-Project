# AI for Artificial, Intelligent Game Opponents

## Overview
This project explores the development of artificial intelligence systems for creating intelligent and adaptive game opponents within Unreal Engine. The goal is to design and implement AI behaviors that can react strategically to player actions, enhancing the gameplay experience and realism.

## Objectives
- Implement decision-making and movement behaviors for AI-controlled opponents.
- Use Unreal Engine tools such as Behavior Trees, Blackboards, and AI Controllers.
- Evaluate how different AI techniques affect gameplay difficulty and engagement.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Unreal Engine 5** – for game environment and AI implementation.
- **Blueprints and C++** – for scripting AI logic and game systems.
- **GitHub** – for version control and progress tracking.

## Current Progress
- Created project repository on GitHub.
- Set up initial Unreal Engine project structure.
- Added README for documentation and progress tracking.

## Next Steps
- Design the basic game environment for AI testing.
- Implement AI Controller and Behavior Tree structure.
- Begin testing simple patrol and chase behaviors.
