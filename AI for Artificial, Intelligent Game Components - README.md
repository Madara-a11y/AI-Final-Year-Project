# AI for Artificial, Intelligent Game Opponents

## Overview
This project explores the development of artificial intelligence techniques for creating intelligent game-playing opponents. The goal is to design and implement AI agents that can adapt, learn, and respond strategically to player actions, enhancing gameplay experience and realism.

## Objectives
- Implement AI decision-making systems inspired by real-world and game AI approaches.
- Integrate AI behaviors within a game environment (potentially using Unreal Engine).
- Evaluate agent performance and learning efficiency through simulation and testing.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – for AI logic, simulation, and data analysis.
- **Unreal Engine** – for creating and testing gameplay environments.
- **GitHub** – for version control and collaboration.

## Current Progress
- Created project repository.
- Added initial Python file (`ai_agent.py`) for AI logic structure.
- Set up version control for iterative development.

## Next Steps
- Define the architecture for the AI agent (e.g., state machine, behavior tree, or reinforcement learning).
- Begin implementing basic movement or decision-making logic.
- Integrate AI with a simple Unreal Engine prototype.
